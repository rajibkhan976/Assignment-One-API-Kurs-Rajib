Hur används HTTP-protokollet när du surfar in på en websida?
```
HTTP is an application layer protocol. A web browser is a HTTP client that sends a request to a HTTP server 
(web server) through Universal Resource Identifier (URI), which is used to identify resources. The request 
also consists of methods, headers and body. The server processes processes the request after receiving it and 
then sends response that consists of response code and appropriate data with headers and body. This is called 
'Request Response Model'.
Example of URI: https://www.w3schools.com/
Example of HTTP Headers: "Content-Type: application/json" (specifies the format of the request that is sent),
"Accept: application/json" (specifies the format of the response)
Example of HTTP Response Code:500 (Internal Server Error)
```
