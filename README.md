Hur används HTTP-protokollet när du surfar in på en websida?
```
HTTP is an application layer protocol. A web browser is a HTTP client that sends a request to a HTTP server (web server) through Universal 
Resource Identifier (URI), which is used to identify resources. The request also consists of methods, headers and body. The server processes
processes the request after receiving it and then sends response that consists of response code and appropriate data with headers and body.
This is called 'Request Response Model'.
